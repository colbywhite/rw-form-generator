# rw-form-generator

https://githubbox.com/colbywhite/rw-form-generator

This is a demo of creating a form via the proposed `AutoForm` component.
This component takes in a `zod` schema and generates a functional form for you.

This demo (found at `web/src/components/AutoFormDemo/AutoFormDemo.tsx`) generates a form based on a schema in `web/src/schemas/CreateUser.ts`.

Fork this [codesandbox](https://githubbox.com/colbywhite/rw-form-generator) and make changes to the schema and see if you can recreate real forms you have used before.
It's not expected you'll be able to create every type of form, but that's the feedback we're looking for.
What features are missing you would need to create a form?
Take a look and fill out this survey to give feedback to help direct the project.
