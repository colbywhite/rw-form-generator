# rw-form-generator

This is an example project used to work through what a possible Redwood form generator would look like.

It currently has a `CreateUserForm` that's built the traditional "Redwood way." From there, we're trying to figure out how to generate it via a generator.

# Usage

```shell
yarn start          # start the Redwood app
yarn generate:form  # run the WIP generator
```
