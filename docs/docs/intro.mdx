![npm bundle size (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/%40colbyw/autoform)

The `AutoForm` component takes in a [zod] schema and generates a functional form for you so you never have to deal with a `input` tag again.

```tsx
const MyForm = () => {
  const schema = z.object({
    email: z
      .string({ required_error: 'Email address is required' })
      .min(1, 'Email address is required')
      .email('Please enter a valid email address'),
    name: z
      .string({ required_error: 'Name is required' })
      .min(1, 'Name is required')
  })

  const onSubmit = (result: { email: string; name: string }) =>
    console.log('Submitted', result)
  return (
    <AutoForm aria-label="Basic usage" schema={schema} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <Submit>Submit form</Submit>
    </AutoForm>
  )
}
```

This figures out the expected HTML based upon the [zod] validation, meaning you don't have to figure it out yourself.
Simply define your data structure using a schema, and `AutoForm` takes care of the rest, rendering a fully operational form based on your schema.

## Dependencies

The implementation of `AutoForm` is intended to be glue between [zod] and [react-hook-form], the package that drives [Redwood's form tools](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/forms).

## Installation

In theory, this package will work in a regular React project, but it is intended to be used in a RedwoodJS context and depends on the [@redwoodjs/forms] package.

To use in a Redwood context, install it to the web side of your project.

```shell
yarn workspace web add @colbyw/autoform@1.0.0-rc.2
```

## Usage

See the [usage](./category/usage) docs for more info.
